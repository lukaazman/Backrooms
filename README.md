# 🟨 Backrooms – UE4 Horror Game  
*Graduation Project (2022/2023)*

Inspired by the Backrooms internet lore: endless yellow halls, strange entities, and the illusion of escape.  
This game was created solo in Unreal Engine 4 using Blueprints and free assets.

*The current version on the repository is optimized for Unreal Engine 5.3, as newer versions introduce issues with Emissive lighting.*
