**Graduation Project (2022/2023)**

## 📖 About

The game centers around an **infinite maze** filled with unpredictable anomalies. Each of the first five levels introduces new threats, mechanics, and unsettling environments.

Players collect letters in every level that hint at escape – but in the end, they discover the truth:  
> ❝ You were never meant to escape. ❞

The game concludes in a mysterious surveillance room — and a final jumpscare that reinforces the overarching deception.
